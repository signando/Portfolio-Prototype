                            Good people...<br>If you can't find one...<br>Be one!!!<br>And if you can find one...<br>Cherish it!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every problem has a solution...<br>It may sometimes just need another perspective...<br>And if there seem to be no solution...<br>Maybe it's a trueth to be accepted!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To find a mountain path all by oneself,<br>gives a greater feeling of strength and satisfaction<br>than to take a path that is shown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's easy to give up at the beginning of something,<br>but after gaining a bit of momentum...<br>it's not as easy to just give up!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Good timber does not grow with ease...<br>The stronger the wind,<br>the stronger the trees!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But noble souls,<br>through dust and heat,<br>Rise from desaster and defeat the stronger!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We make a living by what we get...<br>But we make a life by what we give.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People grow through experience,<br> if they meet life honestly and courageously...<br>This is how the character is built.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Use what talent you posses...<br>The woods would be very silent if no birds sang there,<br> exept those that sang best!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Life is really simple...<br>But we insist on making it complicated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A life lived for others is a life worthwhile.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Life is not about finding yourself...<br>Life is about creating yourself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Which way we choose to see our life in the future...<br>Depends on our attitude today!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our prime purpose in this life is to help others...<br>And if we can't help them, at least don't hurt them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Life's most persistent and urgent question is...<br>What are we doing for others?
                        </p>
                        <p>Hate is the venom that consumes its host.</p>
                        <p>A greatefull heart is better than a bitter soul.</p>
                        <p>
                            Don't be afraid of death...<br>Be afraid of an unlived life.<br>We dont have to live forever...<br>We just have to live.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end,<br>it's not the years in our life that count.<br>It's the life in our years!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Life is not only a process of discovery...<br>But also a process of creation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's not so much what we have in this life that matters...<br>It's what we do with what we have.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Its not how long...<br>But how well we live that matters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are here to add what we can to life...<br>Not to get what we can from it!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be such a pearson, and live such a life...<br>That if every pearson was such as you,<br>and every life a life like yours...<br>The earth would be God's paradise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The quality of life is more important than life itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Life is not measured by length...<br>But by depth...<br>Birthdays tell us how long we have been on the road...<br>Not how far we have travelled.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sow an action and you reap a habit...<br>Sow a habit and you reap a character...<br>Sow a character and you reap a destiny!!!  
                        </p>
                        <P>
